# To_Do-List-Using-React
## A simple To-do List using useStates
This project is a simple React To-Do List application built using the useState hook. It allows users to manage their tasks by adding new tasks, marking tasks as done, deleting tasks, and automatically distinguishing tasks with duplicate names using a unique ID assigned to each task object.

## Features
**Add Task** : You can add a new task to the list by typing the task name in the input field and clicking the "Add" button.

**Mark as Done**: When you complete a task, you can mark it as done. The task's text will turn green to indicate completion.

**Delete Task**: If you want to remove a task from the list, you can click the "Delete" button next to the task.

**ID-based Duplication Handling**: Even if you have tasks with the same name, they will be distinguished from each other using a unique ID assigned to each task object. This ensures that each task is treated as a separate entity.
